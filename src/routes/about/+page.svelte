			<p>
				my name is Joshua Saitong, and I am a graphic designer currently residing in Kristiansand,
				Norway. In my free time, I share common interests with many others. I have a passion for
				various sports and maintain an active lifestyle through regular gym visits and personal
				challenges. Additionally, I have a profound appreciation for the artistic aspects of things
				like comedy, art, architecture, and sports. Furthermore, I get great pleasure from creating,
				experimenting with, and savoring diverse food expierences
			</p>
			<p>
				However, when I sit in front of the computer, my primary focus is on crafting aesthetically
				pleasing designs. I find immense satisfaction in tackling ambitious and innovative projects.
				My ultimate goal is to help you, as a customer or company, visualize and enhance your brand
				through my design expertise. I look forward to the possibility of working together, and I
				hope we will be in touch soon
